### This is a clone of the original repository: https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp
I have removed Flask and uvicorn from dependencies. I will try to mantain this repository up to date with the original one.

## Installation

To install the library you can either use pip (latest release version):

``pip install whatsapp-python``

You can also install the development GitHub version (always up to date):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoandresaav/whatsapp-python-cloud-api.git
cd whatsapp
pip install .
```

If you want to use a local enviroment you can also use hatch:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoandresaav/whatsapp-python-cloud-api.git
cd whatsapp
pip install hatch
hatch shell
```

Documentation is available in the [wiki section](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki) on GitHub.

## Why choose this library?

The main reason why I decided to fork the original library is that it uses an old version of the API, it's missing many useful features and it's almost not mantained anymore.

In this fork I added app events (to listen to incoming messages) and implemented an easier way to send/receive messages and media by using the `Message` object.

I fixed some bugs and added many features, however the library still needs a lot of work to be done even if it's working and usable.

### Supported features:

- Listening to events (messages, media, etc.)
- Sending messages
- Marking messages as read
- Reacting to messages
- Sending Media (images, audio, video and documents)
- Sending location
- Sending interactive buttons
- Sending template messages
- Parsing messages and media received

## Obtaining the WhatsApp API credentials

To use the WhatsApp API you need to create a Facebook Business account and a WhatsApp Business account.

> [!TIP]  
> To create an account, I recommend to follow [this video](https://youtu.be/d6lNxP2gadA).

## Pricing of the API

Whereas using third-party providers of the WhatsApp API can result in monthly fees, using the WhatsApp API[^1] offered directly by Facebook is much cheaper, even if the billing documentation is quite difficult to understand.

> [!CAUTION]  
> It is now mandatory to add a credit card to the WhatsApp account (at least for me) in order to use the service. I was even charged a fee for using a non-test phone number (~â‚¬1.20), so be careful when using the API! I'm not responsible for any costs you may face by using the API.

All the prices are available in the [**WhatsApp API docs**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing).

> [!TIP]  
> One recommendation I can give you is to use a test number (you can get a free phone number and use it for testing purposes only).

## Migrating from `Neurotech-HQ/heyoo`

*You can ignore this if it's your first time using the library.*

- Any version >1.1.2 is incompatible with the original `heyoo` library! Be careful updating! Read the docs first!
- Any version <=1.1.2 is fully compatible with the original `heyoo` library and doesn't include breaking changes.

Switching from heyoo to whatsapp-python doesn't require any change for versions up to 1.1.2: just uninstall `heyoo`, install `whatsapp-python==1.1.2` and change the import name from `heyoo` to `whatsapp`.

For versions GREATER THAN 1.1.2, messages have became objects, so you need to change your code to use the new methods.

> [!NOTE]  
> Documentation for version 1.1.2 can be found [here](https://github.com/filipporomani/whatsapp/wiki/v1.1.2).
